        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>You've reached Matthew Wolff's personal web site. I'm still working on making it dynamic, but in the meantime, you can look below for a list of important projects, or download my PGP public key and a PDF of my resume. I just recently made it material-ly. Isn't that nice?</p>
        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <ul class="mdc-card">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/matthewjwolff/TwitchBullet" >TwitchBullet</a>: A physics simulation of colliding galaxies. Intended for twitch.tv streamers as an incentive to donate with Twitch's bits system. Bit polygons will orbit and collide with each other as viewers donate to their favorite streamwers. Written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and the Bullet physics library.</li>
            <li><a href="http://neutralsnap.com" >NeutralSite</a> (<a href="https://github.com/matthewjwolff/NeutralSite">GitHub</a>): Website for Neutral Snap, my friends' cover band. Hey if you want to hire them, go to the site and shoot an email to their manager. They put on a good show. Uses Bootstrap, but I'll probably get rid of that. If you want it to look unique, you've gotta write it yourself.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I am a classical pianist, holding a minor in music from the LSU School of Music in the studio of Professor Greg Sioles. Through Professor Sioles I can trace my piano heritage back to Bart√≥k, Liszt, and Beethoven. I also studied throughout elementary and high school with Ms. Susan Settoon. Some of my performances are posted on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFJGOIU8xob1WFpFamt3Bng" >YouTube</a> channel.</p>
        <p>I have also studied music programming and sound design with Dr. Jesse Allison of LSU's Experimental Music and Digital Media department. I mainly write in <a href="https://puredata.info" >pd</a> but I've also used <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/" >Max</a>. So far I've mainly focused on emulating popular keyboard instruments in software. </p>
        <ul class="mdc-card">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/matthewjwolff/TonewheelOrgan" >Tonewheel organ</a> (Hammond organ) with emulated rotary (Leslie) speaker. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rabidwolff55/athletic-theme-yoshis-island">Old demo</a> from the Max version</li>
            <li>Mellotron soundfont. Currently not hosted, since the soundfont and source samples make for a rather large project. Email me if you're interested. The samples were taken from <a href="http://leisureland.us/audio/MellotronSamples/MellotronSamples.htm">this guy's</a> web site. I don't know him but he seems pretty cool for providing high quality sources. </li>
        </ul>
