        <h1>Hey</h1>
        <p>You've reached Matthew Wolff's personal web site. </p>
        <h3>Current Projects</h3>
        <ul class="card shadow">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/matthewjwolff/UIOHookNet">UIOHookNet</a>: .NET bindings for <a href="https://github.com/kwhat/libuiohook">uiohook</a>, a universal input/output hook written in C. Compatible with X11 (Linux), macOS, and Windows.</li>
            <li>EmojiBoard: Helper program to emoji characters on a physical keyboard. Uses UIOHookNet (my own project) and GTK#. Currently unreleased.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Parked Projects</h3>
        <p>These are projects that I've invested some time in, but have been left incomplete. I doubt I'll finish them up, but I did learn quite a bit from them.</p>
        <ul class="card shadow">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/matthewjwolff/TwitchBullet" >TwitchBullet</a>: A physics simulation of colliding galaxies. Intended for twitch.tv streamers as an incentive to donate with Twitch's bits system. Bit polygons will orbit and collide with each other as viewers donate to their favorite streamwers. Written in C++ using OpenGL, GLFW, and the Bullet physics library.</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>I am a classical pianist, holding a minor in music from the LSU School of Music in the studio of Professor Greg Sioles. Through Professor Sioles I can trace my piano heritage back to Bart√≥k, Liszt, and Beethoven. I also studied throughout elementary and high school with Ms. Susan Settoon. Some of my performances are posted on my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFJGOIU8xob1WFpFamt3Bng" >YouTube</a> channel. Below are some links to those instruments.</p>
        <p>I have also studied music programming and sound design with Dr. Jesse Allison of LSU's Experimental Music and Digital Media department. I mainly write in <a href="https://puredata.info" >pd</a> but I've also used <a href="https://cycling74.com/products/max/" >Max</a>. So far I've mainly focused on emulating popular keyboard instruments in software. </p>
        <ul class="card shadow">
            <li><a href="https://github.com/matthewjwolff/TonewheelOrgan" >Tonewheel organ</a> (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/rabidwolff55/apocalypse-in-98-organ">demo</a>) with emulated rotary speaker. <a href="https://soundcloud.com/rabidwolff55/athletic-theme-yoshis-island">Old demo</a> from the Max version. You might recognize these instruments by their trade names: Hammond organ and Leslie speaker. </li>
            <li>Mellotron soundfont (<a href="https://soundcloud.com/rabidwolff55/watcher-of-the-skies-intro">demo</a>). Currently not hosted, since the soundfont and source samples make for a rather large project. Email me if you're interested. The samples were taken from <a href="http://leisureland.us/audio/MellotronSamples/MellotronSamples.htm">this guy's</a> web site. I don't know him but he seems pretty cool for providing high quality sources. </li>
        </ul>
